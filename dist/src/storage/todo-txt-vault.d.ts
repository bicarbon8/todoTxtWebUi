 * This javascript was created according to the specifications at

 *
 * Once initially uploaded, the todo.txt file will
 * be loaded into an HTML5 localStorage and managed from there.
 * The web page then allows downloading changes back to the user
 * in a txt format compliant with the todo.txt specifications, but
 * having re-sorted the tasks.
